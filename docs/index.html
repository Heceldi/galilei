I'm going to be working on a GUI front end for the FitBit syncing program, galileo. I'll be doing this from the ground up using PyQT for the engine, as galileo uses python, and I'm trying to stick with that convention. <br>
<br>
As this is my first real python project, I do apologize if it seems done in baby steps. I really like my fitbit and I really like linux, and as a former windows user, I like guis. :)
